# Project Overview
Create and deploy a web app that takes in an electricity bill from Spain
and suggest the best (as cheapest) tariff from all available companies.

## 1. Background
The energy market is a very hard place due to high prices, unfair promotions, disloyal sellers, and scams all along.

Only those with good market or energy knowledge make it through paying the minimum, it's a very complicated enterprise.

## 2. Value Proposition
To enable anyone to get the best electricity tariff by only providing past bills.

## 3. Objectives
- Build a cloud OCR-AI solution to parse electricity bills.
- Connect to *Comparador CNMC* in oder to get all the tariffs.
- Fill the fields of CNMC with the data parsed from the bills.
- Get the results and rate them.
- Build a web application around it.
- Publish it to the public, open-source.

## 4. Solution
Build a web-app with capabilities on:
- OCR
- AI
- Web-scraping / API

In order to load an electricity bill and get out some tariff suggestion

## 5. Feasibility
There are some AI models and pre-built web-apps which do some work,
so the proposition is to connect the pieces in order to make it a full web-app

## 6. Data
There are pre-built models of OCR which will do perfectly as trained neural network,
so no more data will be needed.

## 7. Metrics
The output should be checked manually, and tried over many bills. Accuracy should be computed.

## 8. Evaluation
The manual checking of bills and best suggestion.

## 9. Modeling
Full model inside a notebook.

## 10. Experimentation
Create a notebook to simulate all the process and finetune-it.

## 11. Feedback
Contact friends with more experience in order to share coding-review,
and get some trusted people to try the app and give honest feedback.

## 12. Project
Convert the notebook into production code and web-app.
